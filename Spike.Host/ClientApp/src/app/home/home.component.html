<h5>Background</h5>
<p>
  Module loading is the basis of being capable of providing a 3rd party evolvable
  ecosystem.
  <br />
  Except that the <code>Asp.Net Core</code> framework didn't think this was something important enough to solve for.
  <br />
</p>
<h5>Problem</h5>
<p>
  Whereas <code>IServiceCollection</code> can be populated as the source
  for making the <code>IServiceProvider</code> at startup,
  the <code>IServiceProvider</code> is then locked off from further change...
  ie, there is nowhere to register a new Service
  that becomes only available when a plugin module is loaded.
</p>
<h5>Tasks</h5>
<p>
  There are a few things to wire up when loading a module:
  Services, Web API Controllers, and
  - optionally - OData COntrollers and their
  associated EDM model.
</p>

<h5>Debugging</h5>
Use the following to know what services are available:
<ul>
  <li><a href="$odata" target="_blank">$OData</a>  Shows list of registered services.</li>
</ul>


https://localhost:7245/api/rest/base/v1/exampleh1
<h5>Example Host Controllers</h5>
At startup, one should see only the API endpoints that existed in Base:
<!-- As we're just interested in api calls, the following don't open views -->
<ul>
  <li><a href="/api/rest/base/v1/exampleH1" target="_blank">H1</a>  Invokes a Base Web API controller, no DI required.</li>
  <li><a href="/api/rest/base/v1/exampleH2" target="_blank">H2</a>  Invokes a Base Web API controller, DI used.</li>
  <li><a href="/api/odata/base/v1/exampleO1" target="_blank">O1</a>  Invokes a Base ODATA controller, DI used.</li>
</ul>


<h5>Module DLL Loader</h5>
<b>Important:</b>
  As <code>Modules.Example</code> proj
  is <b>not</b>&nbsp;<i>Referenced</i>
  from <code>Host</code>,
<code>F6</code> first
  to Build & push to
<code>Host</code>'s
<code>MODULES</code> direcotry,
  so that it can be found by:
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="/api/rest/base/v1/loadmodule" target="_blank">
      Click <i>once</i> to late load a Module...then continue below...
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    What's happening behind the scenes is in
    the implementation of
    <code>IModuleLoadingService</code>
    which is
    <ul>
      <li>creating a new <code>AppModuleLoadContext : AssemblyLoadContext</code> to load the module's assembly into,</li>
      <li>creating a new <code>Autofac ILifetimeScope</code> to register new module Services/Controllers into,</li>
      <li>recording info in a singleton <code>ControllerTypeToScopeDictionary</code> for use later</li>
      <li>by <code>AppServiceBasedControllerActivator : IControllerActivator</code> to instantiate new module Controllers</li>
      <li>And now (finally!) EDM models are being registered...</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <i>note: one day (not today) we'll get around to showing a Nuget plugin option lister, picker, etc..</i>
</p>
<h5>Example Module Controller</h5>
Once loaded... the new Controllers should be available (hint, recheck "~/odata").
<!-- As we're just interested in api calls, the following don't open views -->
<ul>
  <li><a href="/api/rest/module/v1/examplem1" target="_blank">M1</a> Shows DI of a framework service work (works).</li>
  <li><a href="/api/rest/module/v1/examplem2" target="_blank">M2</a> Shows DI of a previously registered Host service (works). </li>
  <li><a href="/api/rest/module/v1/examplem3" target="_blank">M3</a> Shows DI of a new Module service (works).</li>
</ul>
<i>
  And...the cherry on the top...is now working!
  <br />
  The following OData Controller is accessible as an OData controller
  (you can also verify this in <code>~/$odata/</code> where it is listed in the odata section...)
  ! (At last...)
</i>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/api/odata/module/v1/RenamedO1" target="_blank">O1</a> Shows DI of a new Module service (doesn't <b><i>really</i></b> work).</li>
</ul>

<h5>Next</h5>
  Frankly, even if it is admittedly a PoC,
  I'm still concerned as to the hacky way of solving this.
<ul>
  <li>
    <code>ControllerTypeToScopeDictionary</code> / <code>AppServiceBasedControllerActivator</code>
    seems so sketchy that I'm hoping someone slaps me over the back of the head and says there is a MUCH simpler way to do the
    same thing...
  </li>
  <li>
    Not to mention the way we're adding the secondary EDM model...(amazed it works actually...)
  </li>
  <li>
    Or the probably dangerously primitive
    security measures of decompiling code to look into it to
    see if any of it is hitting the file system, or Activating things...
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  But does anybody have a better example on how to
  load Plugins in an Asp.Net Core service?
